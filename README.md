# mdBook-bujinkan-template
A mdBook template for Bujinkan practitioners.

The names and kata listings are from a great webpage [wanderings in budo](https://bujinshugyo.wordpress.com/) with some additions of my own.

## How to use
Please see [mdBook install instructions](https://github.com/azerupi/mdBook) and [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) by GitHub.

You can edit the `src/SUMMARY.md` if you want to change or edit any chapters of the text.

Basically, when you are done with your updates, build the book with `mdbook build` and you can open `book/index.html` locally or upload the page to your server.
